Description: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
 Yarn: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
 .
 Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It
 also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times
 are faster than ever.
 .
 Reliable: Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic
 algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked
 on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.
 .
 Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package
 before its code is executed.
